# ContactMaster: AVL Tree-Powered PhoneBook Application
This project involves developing a PhoneBook application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. It incorporates AVL Tree data structure for efficient contact management and provides functionalities for adding, updating, searching, and deleting contacts(CRUD operations).

1. Define Classes:
   - Implemented AVLTreeNode to represent nodes in the AVL Tree.
   - Created Contact class to store contact details and support comparison operations.

2. Develop AVL Tree Operations:
   - Developed AVLTree class with methods for insertion, deletion, and rotation to maintain balance.
   - Implemented tree traversal, searching, and balancing methods.

3. Implement Contact Management Functions:
   - Created functions for adding, displaying, searching, updating, and deleting contacts using the AVL Tree.

4. Build GUI with Tkinter:
   - Developed a Tkinter GUI to facilitate user interactions.
   - Added buttons for different operations: adding, displaying, searching, updating, and deleting contacts.
   - Implemented a listbox to display contacts and used dialogs for user input.

5. Integrate Functions with GUI:
   - Connected GUI buttons to corresponding functions for handling contacts.
   - Used message boxes and input dialogs for user interactions and notifications.

6. Testing and Validation:
   - Tested the application to ensure that all functionalities (insertion, deletion, updating,       searching, and displaying) work correctly.
   - Validated input data and ensured the AVL Tree maintained balance and performance with           various operations.
